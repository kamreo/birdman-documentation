# A* Pathfinding 
For our enemies we use A* pathfinding algorythm which is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science
due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

# Version control 
We use git as a version control system an we have two branches: develop and master. Develop is a branch for testing and making sure that features work, we also start our 
development from this branch and master is a branch where every funcionality is tested and working.
